# A Diary App
## Treehouse iOS Project 8

A Diary App is a Core Data-based Diary App in Swift. 

This project uses:
 * A Basic Master-Detail View Architecture
 * Dynamic UITableViews
 * Frameworks - CoreData, CoreLocation, MapKit
 * Error Handling
 * Autolayout
 * Data Modelling
 * NSFetchedResultsController and Delegates
 
### Project Instructions

  1. Create the Core Data driven Diary app using a TableView-based approach, with both Master and Detail Views.
  
  2. Make sure users can scroll through the Master View to see a list of existing entries. In the Master View, the user should be able to:
    
      * Create a new entry and be presented with the Detail View for data entry
      * Tab on an existing entry to see the entry details in the corresponding Detail View
      * Edit an existing entry (again with the corresponding Detail View)
      * Delete an existing entry
    
   3. All diary content should remain intact after a user exit and relaunch the app. All diary entries should have and display a "created-on" or "last updated" date
   
   4. Add functionality such that users can add geolocation data to an entry
   
### Extra Credit

  * Add the ability to add one or more photos to a diary entry
  * Add the ability to search the entries via a search bar on the Master View
  * For the features listed as extra credit, you may employ third party libraries, if you find that helpful. Please do provide detailed comment and usage instructions for the third party libraries, such that the project can be reviewed properly
